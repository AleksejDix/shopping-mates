In this loop we ask 3 things – all of which must be true to add a page to the subnav menu:

1. Does this page’s URL contain the `base_url`? This eliminates pages at the same menu depth, but with different parent items

2. Is the page at the same menu depth as the page currently being viewed? This eliminates items below the current menu depth

3. Is page’s filename `index.html`? This eliminates pages that should exist one level higher in the menu tree
