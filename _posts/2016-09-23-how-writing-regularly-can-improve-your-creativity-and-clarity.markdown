Starting or running a business is a risky endeavor. Entrepreneurs and artists deal with a storm of surprises and self-doubt, and they need to constantly learn and adapt to steer the ship to safety.

I’ve found that one of the best avenues for problem solving is writing. The process of putting pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) allows us to digest and distill experiences mindfully.

Here’s an example: If you keep ramming your head into a project, it’s worth pausing and writing about it to understand your thinking process. You might normally go over the problem again and again in your mind, but writing your thoughts out to see the language you’re using—and for a colleague to read and provide feedback on—is a far more fruitful method to untangle the mess in your mind.

> As much as writing is about communicating to others, it begins with self-reflection.

As Terry Tempest said in ***Why We Write***, “I write to make peace with things I cannot control. I write to create a fabric in a world that often appears black and white. I write to discover. I write to uncover. I write to meet my ghosts. I write to begin a dialogue. I write to imagine things differently and in imagining things differently perhaps the world will change.”

Let’s take a look at the benefits of building a habit of writing.

## Public and Personal Writing

The kind of writing I’m suggesting falls into two categories: public and personal.

## Public

Compared to a decade or two ago, it’s easier than ever before for entrepreneurs to have their own public platforms where they can share ideas and build a legacy. Think [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html), [Marie Forleo](http://www.marieforleo.com/), [Bernadette Jiwa](http://www.thestoryoftelling.com/about/), [Warren Buffett](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/09/08/investing-tips-from-warren-buffett-try-writing-tips-instead/), or any important person in an organization who writes. When you share in a public forum, your posture is different; you have an idea or perspective to stand behind. It takes guts to share your thoughts for the masses to read, but doing so encourages a firm stance on what you believe.

## Personal

Equivalent to a private journal, personal writing is about self-reflection. You may write about a deal that might not go through and how it might affect your business—the things you will eventually have to say to your team and investors
